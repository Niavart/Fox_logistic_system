This project exist beacause I had enough doing roundtrips beetween refinery and production, checking the wiki or using excel to calculate.<br/>
Feel free to use the code or fork the project if you need (source [here](https://github.com/NicolasBarlogis/foxhole-logi-calculator "here"))<br/>
Data where updated on the 28th of May 2021.<br/>


## Missing data
I still miss some data to make this tool exhaustive. If you have any info, feel free to contact me on discord: Krun#6584. Or see you on Warden side Shard 2 (while this Shard still exist).
- Missing formula for time estimation in the MPF (!)
- Incorrect icon for 'vehicle' category in MPF

- Missing production time for 'Malone MKK.2'
- Missing production time for 'Bonesaw MK.3'
- Missing production time for 'Mounted Bonesaw MK.3'
- Missing production time for 'Alligator Charge'



## Roadmap
Todo
- Add time estimation to MPF (missing formula, see above)
- Add all missing data
- Refactor code (lot of duplications, coded quickly and badlly)

<br/>

Might do
- Add Colonials data
- Portable app
- Create similar tool for other purposes (bunker upgrade cost, structure destruction cost, ...)
